    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">To share the love of medieval arts to everyone and every living thing.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">This store was based off of a fantasy. This shop is the first Fantasy Medieval to open an online store. Casper Cloud and Peter Parker met in Harvard University in a Witchcraft class. They noticed each other's passion and skills on potions, spells, and magic. Once they started a small business from the ground up, they knew they had open to offer in this world. After years and years of hard work, they launched their first store in 2011, and sold over 2 million products within the first year. Since then, they opened up 30+ stores in Europe. They launched their online website in 2015.</p>
