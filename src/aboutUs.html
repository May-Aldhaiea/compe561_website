    <p style="text-align:center;">To share the love of medieval arts to everyone and every living thing.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">This store was based off of a fantasy. This shop is the first Fantasy Medieval to open an online store.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Casper Cloud and Peter Parker met in Harvard University in a Witchcraft class. They noticed each other's passion and skills on potions, spells, and </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">magic. Once they started a small business from the ground up, they knew they had open to offer in this world.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">After years and years of hard work, they launched their first store in 2011, and sold over 2 million products within the first year. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Since then, they opened up 30+ stores in Europe. They launched their online website in 2015.</p>
